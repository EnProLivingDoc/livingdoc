== Using Document Repositories

In LivingDoc you can configure where the Executable Document is stored.
A Document Repository is a configurable Location for multiple Executable Document.
LivingDoc provides currently three types of Document Repository, but it is also possible to create an own Document Repository type if it's not supported jet.

Supported Document Repositories:
* File Repository
* REST Repository
* Confluence Repository

=== Confluence Repository

The Confluence Repository uses the unique DocumentID to identify the Executable Documents.
