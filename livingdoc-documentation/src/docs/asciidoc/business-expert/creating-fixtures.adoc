== Creating Fixtures
While writing fixtures in HTML and Markdown are straightforward using tables and list elements, the usage of Confluence needs more details.
In Confluence you work in a different environment than with simple files.

=== Confluence
Working with Confluence is straightforward.
It offers many tools for editing and creating pages.
For a more detailed documentation of how to use the editor in Confluence have a look at the link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/the-editor-251006017.html[official page].

==== Decision Table
A simple Confluence page for a decision table might look like this.
You can insert your tables anywhere on your page, putting text and descriptions before or after them.

You can add more calculations by adding more columns.
So you don't have to create multiple tables for the same input values but different calculations/actions.

==== Scenario
To use scenario you need to add a bullet list.
Each entry in this list represents a scenario.
Using the format described earlier a example could look like the following.

As well as in decision tables, you can add text before and after the list.
So you can place it wherever you want inside the page.
