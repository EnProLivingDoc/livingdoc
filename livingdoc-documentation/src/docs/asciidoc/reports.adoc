Configure the generation of Reports in the `living-doc.yaml` file.
The `living-doc.yaml` contains the yaml based configuration of LivingDoc.

    format: "html"
    config:
      outputDir: "livingdoc/reports/html"
----
`reports` is a list of different reports.
Each report have a `name` as unique identifier.
Each report also specifies the `format` of the generated Report.
Optionally a `config` can be specified for Report format specific parameters.

Configuration from the command line and environment dependent configuration can be archived using the Java System Property `livingdoc.reports.include` to specify a coma separated list of report names that should be generated.
The provided list act as a whitelist, so only reports from the list are generated.
If this property is not specified all reports that are configured are generated.
