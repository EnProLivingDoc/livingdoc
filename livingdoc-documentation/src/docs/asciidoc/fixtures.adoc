=== Special Cases
This section shows some details that are valid for decision tables and scenarios.

==== Expecting Exceptions as Output
Some inputs lead to an `Exception` being thrown.
As a business expert, you can expect this to happen by using the keyword `error` as expected value in the
decision table or scenario.
If an `Exception` is thrown and expected, the test is marked as executed successfully.
